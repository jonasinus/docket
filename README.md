# Docket

This software is designed to securely manage all sorts of userdata.

It achives this by letting the user select which data stays on device, is synced and if he prefers to use a custom api implementation for their data.
Communication is by default encrypted using a RSA+AES hybrid encryption sceme on top of https.

The official backend is opensource and can be found on [Github](https://github.com/jonasinus/docket-api)

A tutorial can be found in the actual frontend implementation at <code>&lt;endpoint&gt;/tutorial</code>

You may contribute to this project by issuing bugfix and feature requests, as well as, after recall with the staff, a designer or developer role! If you are interested, let us know @ [TODO: buy domain, insert email]!
